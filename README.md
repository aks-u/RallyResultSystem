# RallyResultSystem
This C programming project implements a result system for a rally competition consisting of multiple special stages. The program allows users to perform various operations related to race drivers, including adding new drivers, updating their race times, printing the race results, saving the race data to a file, and loading race data from a file.

Enter commands to perform various operations:

* L: Print the current race results.
* W [filename]: Save race data to a file.
